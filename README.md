# SuperStore-Sales-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project-4
I am uploading my Power BI Project 4 files here in this repository. This is going to be a project with some advance concepts like Sales forecasting. 


Title - The Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project visualizes key sales metrics for a superstore, offering a comprehensive breakdown of sales, profits, and trends across regions. It transforms raw data into actionable insights, enabling data-driven decisions through interactive and clear visualizations.


The Major Key Insights are -

1. "Total Sales" – ₹1.6M from 22K units, generating a profit of ₹175K.
2. "Top Regions" – West (33%), East (29%), and South (22%) were the leading regions in sales.
3. "Sales by Category" – Office Supplies, Technology, and Furniture drove the highest sales, with Phones, Chairs, and Binders leading in sub-categories.
4. "Shipping Modes" – Standard Class contributed the most to shipping revenue with ₹912K in sales.
5. "Sales Forecast" – 15-day sales forecast leveraged time series analysis, helping anticipate sales trends for inventory planning.

My Conclusion On The Above Analysis -

1. "Regional Focus": While the West & East regions are strong, sales could be increased in the South & Central regions through regional marketing or discounts.
2. "Product Optimization": Categories like Storage & Bookcases need attention through better promotions or bundling.
3. "Shipping & Delivery": Standard Class is popular, but incentivizing faster shipping options like same-day delivery can improve customer satisfaction.

The Strategic Suggestions That I Would Recommend Based On My Analysis -

1. Focus on "regional campaigns" to boost sales in underperforming areas like the South & Central.
2. Promote "lower-revenue products" like Storage & Bookcases through special marketing strategies.
3. Offer "discounts" on premium shipping (same-day or first class) options to make faster delivery modes more appealing.
4. Address "seasonal profit dips" with tailored marketing during slower months like May, June, July, & December.
